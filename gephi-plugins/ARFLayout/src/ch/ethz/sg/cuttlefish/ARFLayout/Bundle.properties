OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    The ARF layout is developed by the Chair of Systems Design of ETH Z\u00fcrich. \
    It is implemented in Cuttlefish (http://cuttlefish.sf.net), which is a network workbench application that visualizes the networks with some of the best known layout algorithms. \
    The Cuttlefish team ported the ARF layout to Gephi so that Gephi's users can also use it.\n\n\
    The ARF layout algorithm relies on the balancing of two antagonistic forces. \
    It is called ARF for \u201cattractive and repulsive forces\u201d.\n\n\
    Note: Cuttlefish will soon support export to the graphml file format, which would allow its users to visualize their networks with Gephi as well.
